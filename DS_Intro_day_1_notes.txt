Fork vs Clone
need to fork, b/c otherwise will try to change the original
cloning is something you want to change

ex. git clone (link to the git hub repository)

git status
  -lets you see what's changed in Git

git add
  -lets you add your new program to your git

git commit
  -actually saves to your branch
  -have to provide a message, so easier to give on the command line
so use
  git commit my_file -m "Updates that Drew wanted."

git push
  -sends your program

git help

git init

ls -a
  if see a .git (means you're in the right area)

need to make sure to change directory (cd) into
one of your git hub repositories
